# EatSocial

This app is designed to show you what locations are most popular in your social network using Facebook's API and Google Maps.

## Installation
Clone this repository and import into **Android Studio**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/madjacks12/EatSocial
```

## Instructions. 

In order to use the Google Map used in this app you must get an API key here: https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/android-api/signup. <br><br> Next,
 you will need to add a new string to the file strings.xml found in <b>app-> res -> values -> strings.xml</b>. Format your string as follows: `<string name="google_maps_key">YOUR_API_KEY_HERE</string>`.
 
 Due to Facebook's security settings, the only Facebook account the user can query real data from is the developer's Facebook account. If you would like to test this app email me at <mdjacksonvideo@gmail.com> and I will allow you access to a test user's account that will allow you to retrieve a list of my check-in's/ 
 
## Future Plans

I would like to convert Facebook check-in's to Google Places and allow the user to filter check-in's by "type" i.e. "restaurant" or "art_gallery".
